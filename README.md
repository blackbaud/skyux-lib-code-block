The code block component enables you to format a block of text as a code snippet with syntax highlighting. To create a code snippet, wrap sky-code-block tags around the code block. The code block also has a header that displays a copy button and, if defined, the language type. Read the [official documentation](https://docs.blackbaud.com/stache/content/code-block) for more info.
